Executable files for Ludum Dare 33 - Mac/Window/Linux

Greetings

These are the final, bug-free (hopefully) executable files that were my entry for Ludum Dare 33 (Aug 2015).

They are provided as is and may be freely distributed.

The usual legal small print about copyright, fair use etc still applies - so don't be a scumbag and force me to set the law(yers) on to you.

Hope you enjoy them,

Tackorama

Kill All Fairies
---------------------------------

Her impressive elegant queenage, Frogmella Imanokcuf, hereby grants clemency most extraordinaire to all monsters of the realm upon successful execution of all fairies in thy precious kingdom within two minutes.

PS Beware of the sugar plum fairy.

---------------------------------
Controls
---------------------------------
Click mouse. That's it.
M disables music in game (it can get annoying).

---------------------------------
Bugs
---------------------------------
Issue: When going to the options screen in windowed mode the game automatically resizes to the large possible window your display will allow.
Solution: set options once and leave them alone after that.

---------------------------------
Notes
---------------------------------
Game defaults to windowed display of 1280 x 720 - change in options screen.

Tested on Mac and Windows. Linux - sorry - you are the guinea pigs.

I've opted out of graphics judging because:
1) The paper scrolls on the title are clip art (stop looking at me like that).
2) The fairies are based on a free font.

Everything else is original and created within the 72 hours, by one man and his Apple Mac.

Enjoy killing the fairies.
